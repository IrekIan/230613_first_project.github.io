# ISP - group project for WebDev Tækniskólinn 
Internet Service Providers: Irek, Peter, Solveig. <br>
We decided to make up a fictional web developement company and create a website for that company: <br>
Our web development company's website is designed to provide potential clients with essential information.
We showcase our previous projects, discuss our company's vision, and explain how we approach client relationships.
Our aim is to establish trust with potential clients and highlight our expertise and the quality of our work through our website.
Our priority is to create a user-friendly platform that enables clients to make informed decisions about choosing us for their web development needs.
